help-service-hpa   Deployment/help-service      <unknown>/70% 2         5
user-service-hpa   Deployment/user-service      <unknown>/70% 2         5
```

## üîß Configuration Management
- **ConfigMaps**: Environment-specific configurations
- **Secrets**: Secure handling of MongoDB connection strings and JWT secrets
- **Health Probes**: Liveness and readiness probes configured for all services

## üåê API Endpoints

### User Service (http://user-service:3000)
- `POST /api/users/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/users/login` - User authentication
- `GET /api/users/profile` - Get user profile
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

### Help Service (http://help-service:3002)
- `POST /api/help/request` - Create help request
- `GET /api/help/requests` - List help requests
- `PUT /api/help/request/:id` - Update help request
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

### Frontend (http://localhost:32000)
- Complete React UI for user registration, login, and help request management
- Integrated with backend services via API calls

## üß™ Load Balancing Verification
- Multiple pods per service ensure load distribution
- Internal service DNS resolution working correctly
- Cross-service communication verified

## üìà Scaling & Monitoring
- HPA configured for automatic scaling based on CPU usage (70% threshold)
- Resource limits and requests defined for optimal performance
- Health monitoring through Kubernetes probes
