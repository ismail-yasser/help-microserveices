# ðŸ”§ Validation Scripts Debugging and Fixes

## Issue Identified
The validation scripts were failing because they were using relative file paths that didn't account for being executed from the `scripts\task-validation\` directory. All file references needed to be updated to use `..\..\` to navigate back to the project root.

## Scripts Fixed
The following validation scripts have been updated with correct relative paths:

### âœ… **Path Corrections Completed**
1. **01-check-docker-images.bat** - Fixed Dockerfile paths
2. **02-check-deployments.bat** - Fixed K8s deployment file paths  
3. **03-check-services.bat** - Fixed K8s service file paths
4. **04-check-configmaps-secrets.bat** - Fixed ConfigMap and Secret file paths
5. **05-check-api-documentation.bat** - Fixed documentation file paths
6. **07-check-github-repo.bat** - Fixed .git directory path
7. **08-check-health-probes.bat** - Fixed deployment file paths for probe checks
8. **09-check-hpa.bat** - Fixed HPA file paths
9. **10-check-frontend-deployment.bat** - Fixed frontend deployment and source file paths
10. **11-check-frontend-exposure.bat** - Fixed frontend service and ingress file paths
11. **13-check-architecture-diagram.bat** - Fixed documentation file paths
12. **14-check-k8s-organization.bat** - Fixed K8s directory structure paths
13. **15-check-ingress-controller.bat** - Fixed ingress file paths
14. **16-check-github-actions.bat** - Fixed GitHub workflows directory path
15. **17-check-helm-chart.bat** - Fixed Helm chart directory paths

### ðŸ”„ **Path Change Pattern**
- **Before:** `k8s\user-service\user-service-deployment.yaml`
- **After:** `..\..\k8s\user-service\user-service-deployment.yaml`

### âœ… **Scripts Not Requiring Path Fixes**
- **06-check-load-balancing.bat** - Uses kubectl commands only
- **12-check-integration-testing.bat** - Uses kubectl commands only

## Verification Status
- **File Path Tests:** âœ… Confirmed working in terminal
- **Individual Script Tests:** âœ… Task 2 confirmed working correctly
- **Docker Images Detection:** âœ… Path corrections verified

## Next Steps
1. Run complete validation suite to verify all fixes
2. Address any remaining task-specific issues  
3. Update master validation script if needed
4. Document final validation results

## Expected Improvement
With these path corrections, the validation scripts should now:
- âœ… Correctly locate all project files
- âœ… Properly validate file existence
- âœ… Provide accurate task completion status
- âœ… Enable reliable project validation workflow
