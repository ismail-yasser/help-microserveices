# Microservices Kubernetes Setup

This project demonstrates a microservices application deployed on Kubernetes, consisting of:
- Help Service
- User Service
- Frontend

## Project Overview

All services implement health monitoring through:
- **Liveness probes** (`/health` endpoints)
- **Readiness probes** (`/ready` endpoints)
- Kubernetes **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling** (HPA)

Each deployment runs with a minimum of **2 replicas** for high availability.

# Scripts Usage Guide

This guide explains how to use the scripts provided in the `scripts/` folder to manage the services and Kubernetes configurations for the project.

---

## **1. Build and Push Docker Images**
**Script**: `build-and-push-docker.bat`

### **Purpose**:
Builds Docker images for all services (Help Service, User Service, and Frontend) and pushes them to DockerHub.

### **Usage**:
1. Navigate to the `scripts/` folder.
2. Run the script:
   ```cmd
   build-and-push-docker.bat
   ```

---

## **2. Apply Kubernetes Configurations**
**Script**: `apply-k8s-configs.bat`

### **Purpose**:
Applies Kubernetes deployment, service, and HPA configurations for all services.

### **Usage**:
1. Navigate to the `scripts/` folder.
2. Run the script:
   ```cmd
   apply-k8s-configs.bat
   ```

---

## **3. Test Load Balancing**
**Script**: `test-load-balancing.bat`

### **Purpose**:
Tests load balancing by sending multiple requests to the Help Service and User Service.

### **Usage**:
1. Navigate to the `scripts/` folder.
2. Run the script:
   ```cmd
   test-load-balancing.bat
   ```

---

## **4. Test Load Balancing with Pod Logs**
**Script**: `test-load-balancing-with-logs.bat`

### **Purpose**:
Tests load balancing between replicas by sending multiple requests to services while displaying pod logs to observe request distribution.

### **Usage**:
1. Navigate to the `scripts/` folder.
2. Run the script:
   ```cmd
   test-load-balancing-with-logs.bat
   ```

---

## **5. Test Health Endpoints**
**Script**: `test-health-endpoints.bat`

### **Purpose**:
Tests the health and readiness endpoints of all services.

### **Usage**:
1. Navigate to the `scripts/` folder.
2. Run the script:
   ```cmd
   test-health-endpoints.bat
   ```

---

## **4. Validate Services**
**Script**: `validate-services.bat`

### **Purpose**:
Validates the status of pods and services for all components.

### **Usage**:
1. Navigate to the `scripts/` folder.
2. Run the script:
   ```cmd
   validate-services.bat
   ```

---

## **5. Start All Services Locally**
**Script**: `start-local-services.bat`

### **Purpose**:
Starts all services (Help Service, User Service, and Frontend) locally for development or testing.

### **Usage**:
1. Navigate to the `scripts/` folder.
2. Run the script:
   ```cmd
   start-local-services.bat
   ```

---

## **6. Clean Up Kubernetes Resources**
**Script**: `cleanup-k8s.bat`

### **Purpose**:
Deletes all Kubernetes resources for a clean slate.

### **Usage**:
1. Navigate to the `scripts/` folder.
2. Run the script:
   ```cmd
   cleanup-k8s.bat
   ```

---

## **7. Health Check for Services**
**Script**: `health-check.bat`

### **Purpose**:
Sends health check requests to all services (Help Service, User Service, and Frontend).

### **Usage**:
1. Navigate to the `scripts/` folder.
2. Run the script:
   ```cmd
   health-check.bat
   ```

## Notes
- Ensure Docker and Kubernetes are installed and running on your system before using these scripts.
- Update the DockerHub repository names in the scripts if needed.
- For Kubernetes scripts, ensure the `kubectl` command is configured to point to your cluster.
