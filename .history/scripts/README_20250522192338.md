# Kubernetes Deployment Scripts

This directory contains scripts to help you complete all the required tasks for your Kubernetes microservices project.

## Master Utility

For the easiest experience, use the master utility script that provides an interactive menu for all operations:

```
k8s-deployment-utility.bat
```

## Individual Scripts

### Docker Image Management

- **`build-and-push-docker.bat [service-name] [docker-username]`**
  - Builds and pushes Docker image for the specified service
  - Example: `build-and-push-docker.bat help-service yourusername`
### Kubernetes Resource Management

- **`generate-k8s-resources.bat [service-name] [docker-username] [port]`**
  - Generates all Kubernetes YAML files for a service
  - Creates deployment, service, configmap, and HPA files
  - Example: `generate-k8s-resources.bat help-service yourusername 3002`

- **`deploy-k8s-service.bat [service-name]`**
  - Deploys all resources for the specified service
  - Example: `deploy-k8s-service.bat help-service`

### Testing and Validation

- **`test-load-balancing.bat [service-name] [endpoint] [iterations]`**
  - Tests load balancing by making multiple requests to the service
  - Shows which pod serves each request
  - Example: `test-load-balancing.bat help-service /api/help 20`

- **`validate-service-dns.bat [service-name]`**
  - Validates DNS resolution and connectivity for the service
  - Creates a temporary pod to test access within the cluster
  - Example: `validate-service-dns.bat help-service`

- **`capture-pod-screenshot.bat [service-name]`**
  - Captures detailed information about running pods
  - Saves output to a file for submission
  - Example: `capture-pod-screenshot.bat help-service`

### Documentation and GitHub

- **`document-api-endpoints.bat [service-name]`**
  - Generates API documentation for the specified service
  - Creates a Markdown file with endpoints, parameters, and examples
  - Example: `document-api-endpoints.bat help-service`

- **`push-to-github.bat [team-name] [member-name] [commit-message]`**
  - Helps push changes to your personal branch on GitHub
  - Example: `push-to-github.bat team1 john "Add Kubernetes configs and API docs"`

## Development Workflow

1. Create or update your Dockerfile for each service
2. Build and push Docker images using `build-and-push-docker.bat`
3. Generate or update Kubernetes resource files using `generate-k8s-resources.bat`
4. Deploy services to Kubernetes using `deploy-k8s-service.bat`
5. Validate service connectivity with `validate-service-dns.bat`
6. Test load balancing with `test-load-balancing.bat`
7. Capture pod screenshots for submission using `capture-pod-screenshot.bat`
8. Document API endpoints using `document-api-endpoints.bat`
9. Push changes to GitHub using `push-to-github.bat`

## Notes
- Ensure Docker and Kubernetes are installed and running on your system before using these scripts.
- Update the DockerHub repository names in the scripts if needed.
- For Kubernetes scripts, ensure the `kubectl` command is configured to point to your cluster.
