# Kubernetes Microservices Project - Script Suite

## Overview

This document provides a summary of all the scripts created to automate the deployment and management of your Kubernetes microservices application. These scripts are designed to help you complete all the required tasks from building Docker images to testing load balancing.

## Key Scripts

### Master Utility

- **`k8s-deployment-utility.bat`**: Interactive menu-driven tool that combines all functionality.
  - Provides a simple interface to access all other scripts
  - Guides you through the entire workflow from build to deployment

### Docker Image Management

- **`build-and-push-docker.bat`**: Builds and pushes Docker images to DockerHub.
  - Accepts service name and DockerHub username as parameters
  - Handles multiple microservices (frontend, help-service, user-service)
  - Verifies Dockerfile existence before building

### Kubernetes Resource Management

- **`generate-k8s-resources.bat`**: Creates all necessary Kubernetes YAML files.
  - Automatically generates deployment, service, configmap, and HPA configurations
  - Includes liveness and readiness probes
  - Sets up proper resource limits and requests

- **`deploy-k8s-service.bat`**: Deploys all Kubernetes resources for a service.
  - Applies ConfigMaps first, then Services, then Deployments
  - Checks for HPA and applies if available
  - Verifies deployment status after applying

### Testing and Validation

- **`test-load-balancing.bat`**: Tests load balancing across multiple pods.
  - Makes multiple requests to verify traffic distribution
  - Shows which pod serves each request
  - Demonstrates multiple replica functionality

- **`validate-service-dns.bat`**: Validates service discovery within the cluster.
  - Creates a temporary test pod
  - Tests DNS resolution for services
  - Verifies HTTP connectivity

- **`capture-pod-screenshot.bat`**: Captures detailed pod information.
  - Records pod status, logs, and details
  - Saves information to a file for documentation
  - Helps verify deployment success

### Documentation and GitHub

- **`document-api-endpoints.bat`**: Generates API documentation.
  - Creates Markdown files documenting all endpoints
  - Includes request/response examples
  - Documents authentication requirements

- **`push-to-github.bat`**: Pushes changes to your GitHub branch.
  - Creates or switches to your team-member branch
  - Adds, commits, and pushes changes
  - Uses clear commit messages

## Workflow Example

Here's an example workflow using these scripts:

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   ```
   k8s-deployment-utility.bat
   ```
   Choose option 2 to generate Kubernetes resources

2. **Build and Push Images**:
   ```
   build-and-push-docker.bat help-service yourusername
   ```

3. **Deploy to Kubernetes**:
   ```
   deploy-k8s-service.bat help-service
   ```

4. **Verify Service Connectivity**:
   ```
   validate-service-dns.bat help-service
   ```

5. **Test Load Balancing**:
   ```
   test-load-balancing.bat help-service /api/help 20
   ```

6. **Document API**:
   ```
   document-api-endpoints.bat help-service
   ```

7. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```
   push-to-github.bat team1 john "Add Help Service K8s configs"
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Examine the scripts to understand how they work
2. Try running the master utility to see all options
3. Deploy your services using these scripts
4. Test load balancing and service connectivity
5. Generate documentation and submit screenshots for your assignment

All scripts include detailed help information and can be run with no parameters to see usage instructions.
