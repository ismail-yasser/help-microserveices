# Microservices Kubernetes Implementation Summary

## Task Overview

This project involved setting up a Kubernetes infrastructure for a microservices application consisting of three main components:
1. User Service
2. Help Service
3. Frontend

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Docker Image Setup
- Created Dockerfiles for all services
- Built and pushed images to DockerHub (ismaill370/user-service, ismaill370/help-service, ismaill370/frontend)

### 2. Kubernetes Deployment Configuration
- Created deployment files for all services with 2 replicas each
- Implemented proper resource allocation and management
- Set up ConfigMaps for environment variables

### 3. Service Networking
- Configured ClusterIP services for internal service communication (user-service, help-service)
- Set up NodePort service for external frontend access (port 30080)

### 4. Health Monitoring
- Implemented health and readiness endpoints on all services
- Added liveness and readiness probes to Kubernetes deployments
- Created documentation for health endpoints

### 5. Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
- Configured HPAs for user-service and help-service
- Set target CPU utilization to 70%
- Configured min/max replicas (2-5)

### 6. Testing and Validation
- Created scripts for applying configurations
- Set up load testing for verifying load balancing
- Implemented health checks and service validation

## Implementation Details

### Health Monitoring
Services expose two key endpoints:
- `/health` - For liveness probes (basic service health)
- `/ready` - For readiness probes (checks if the service is ready to accept traffic, including database connectivity)

Example response:
```json
{"status":"UP","message":"User Service is healthy"}
```

### ConfigMap Usage
Environment variables like database connection strings are managed through ConfigMaps:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-service-config
data:
  MONGO_URI: mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/user-service
  JWT_SECRET: your-secret-key
```

### Load Balancing
The Kubernetes Service resources distribute traffic among pod replicas based on the standard kube-proxy implementation. This was tested and verified using the `test-load-balancing-with-logs.bat` script.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Health Probes**: Proper implementation of liveness and readiness probes is crucial for pod lifecycle management.
2. **ConfigMaps**: Using ConfigMaps for environment variables keeps deployment files clean and separates configuration from application code.
3. **Error Resolution**: Using logs and kubectl describe to troubleshoot pod startup issues was essential.
4. **Resource Management**: Setting appropriate resource requests and limits helps Kubernetes make better scheduling decisions.

## Next Steps

1. Implement more comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
2. Add Ingress controller for better HTTP routing
3. Set up persistent storage for databases
4. Implement secrets management for sensitive data
